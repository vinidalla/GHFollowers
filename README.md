# GitHub Followers

The GitHub Followers project features functionalities that allow searching for a GitHub username and listing all of its followers. 
Additionally, the app enables searching for a specific name within this collection of users, accessing the profiles of the users loaded in this list 
with various listed information. It also provides access to the GitHub profile (by accessing the Safari browser within the app) and the followers of the searched person. 
The app also includes a favorites list to add people of interest, as well as offering a beautiful Dark Mode.
